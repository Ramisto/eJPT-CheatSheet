# Searching For Publicly Available Exploits

- After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

- Exploit code can easily be found online, however, it is important to note that downloading and running exploit code against a target can be quite dangerous. It is therefore recommended to analyze the exploit code closely to ensure that it work as intended.

## Public Exploits

- There are handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online :
    - ![Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
    - ![Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)
    - ![PacketStorm](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/tags/exploit/)

## Locally/Offline Exploits

- In certains cases, you may not have access to online exploits and as a result, you must be able to use the exploit sources available locally/offline.

- The entire Exploit-DB database of exploits comes pre-packaged with Kali-Linux, consequently providing you with all exploits locally.

- The Exploit-DB offline database of exploits can be accessed and queried with a tool called SearchSploit.

```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install exploitdb -y
ls -al /usr/share/exploitdb

searchsploit -u
searchsploit vsftpd
searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4
searchsploit -t vsftpd

searchsploit remote windows smb | grep -e "EternalBlue"
```
