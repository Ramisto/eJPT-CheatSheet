# Clearing your tracks

The exploitation and post-exploitation phases of penetration test involves actively engaging with target systems and the data that is stored on these systems.

As a result, you may be required to clear/undo any changes you have made to the target systems you have compromised based on the guidelines specified in the rules of engagement.

If you have transferred any files to the target systems you have compromised, keep track of where they have been saved so that you can remove them when done.

A good practice is to store all your scripts, exploit and binaries in the C:\Temp directory on Windows, and the /tmp directory on Linux.

## Clearing your tracks on Windows

### Temp directory and delete files

A good practice is to store all your scripts, exploit and binaries in the C:\Temp directory on Windows

```text
meterpreter > mkdir C:\\Temp && cd C:\\Temp
meterpreter > upload /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe
meterpreter > rm nc.exe
```

### Execute a cleanup resource script from within Meterpreter

```text
meterpreter > resource /root/.msf4/logs/persistence/cleanup.rc
```

### Clearing the windows event logs

```text
meterpreter > clearev
```

## Clearing your tracks on Linux

### Temp directory and delete files

A good practice is to store all your scripts, exploit and binaries in the /tmp directory on Linux.

```text
meterpreter > cd /tmp
meterpreter > upload /usr/share/linux-binaries/linenum.sh
meterpreter > rm linenum.sh
```

### Clearing bash history

```text
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit
```
